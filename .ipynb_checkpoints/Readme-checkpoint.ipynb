    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Every restaurant in New York City is inspected for food safety standards at a minimum of once a year, more frequently where violations are found. Health Inspections are a major source of worry for owners and managers and also a significant source of costs to a food service establishment in the form of fines and lost business where violations are found and a poor rating given. This project takes public available data published by the Department of Health through the New York Open Data program and applies Exploratory Data Analysis to extract explore and visualize trends across 3 areas of business characteristics: Location, Type and History.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Models are created to predict health inspoection outcomes \"sight unseen\". Using the Location, Type and History characteristics of a restaurant it is possible to determine with ~68% accuracy whether or not that establishment will receive an A on its health inspection. Similar levels of accuracy are achived using a larger sparse matrix of 153 categorical features and using a much smaller array of numerical summary statistics of 9 features with the latter performing a much faster training period. However, it was not possible to achieve accurate results by constructing a model trained only a subset of restaurants based in Manhattan and extrapolating the model to all of New York. These can be used as a predictive tool for \"at risk\" restaurants that are concerned over the possiblity of losing their A rating or by restaurant industry consultants attempting to attract new clients. Additionally, this model can be used as a public safety tool for investing resources into neighbourhoods or restaurant types that are outliers for food safety to encourage better practices for food safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work expansion on these models could include additional features such as time based effects on ratings (seasonal or day of week), longer historical effects or incorporate additional data sources such as yelp reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygene inspects all food service establishments to make sure they meet Health Code requirements. Adherence to Health Code food safey requirements is necessary to prevent foodborne illness after it's introduction in 2011 instances of salmonella in New York City fell by 14% in the first year (source: https://ny.eater.com/2019/6/28/18761345/department-of-health-letter-grades-nyc-restaurant-rules) but it has also generates millions of dollars in fines to restaurants. Annual totals for restaurant fines from Dept. of Health Inspections top \\\\$30 million annually and reached \\\\$54 million in 2012 (source: https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/new-york-city-fine-revenues-update/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Penalties for Health Code Violations are effectively twofold. Where violations are found a Notice of Violation is issued and a hearing Date is set for the Health Hearing Division of the Office of Trials and Hearings (OATH), violations can be contested and fines are determined at the OATH hearing. Fines can range from \\\\$200 to \\\\$2,000 and higher for repeat offences. The second form of penalty can occur if a restaurant fails to achieve an A grade. According to a 2012 survey conducted by Baruch College at the City University of New York, 88% of New Yorkers  used the letter grades in making their dining decisions, and 76% felt more confident eating in an “A” grade restaurant(source: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/pr031-17.page). Failing to achieve or maintain an A grade can result in damage to a restaurant's reputation, negative press coverage (Upscale restaurant Per Se's 2014 poor inspection result was reported on by Business Insider - https://www.businessinsider.com/per-se-grade-pending-2014-3) and a loss of customer confidence that leads to a drop in foot traffic, sales and profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of an A grade has restaurants bending over backwards to beat the inspectors (source: https://ny.eater.com/2019/6/28/18761345/department-of-health-letter-grades-nyc-restaurant-rules) and has led to a booming industry of restaurant consultants, performing mock inspections and legal service that will assist in challenging violations at the OATH Hearing. The ability to predict, prior to inspection, whether a restaurant is likely to receive the highly coveted A is an invaluable tool in preparing for the inspection event. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspection Process\n",
    "<img src='images/inspection_process.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "source: [Inspection Cycle Overview](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/inspection-cycle-overview.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Inspections that do not result in an immediate A are subject to re-inspection and/or OATH hearings and may still be able to obtain an A rating but the stigma assosciated with displaying a \"Grade Pending\" Sign and the costs assosciated with tribunal hearings and process adaptations in preparation for reinspection are costly. The ideal outcome is to receive 13 points or fewer during the inspection and immediately be able to display an A rating. Additionally, receiving an A rating allows the restaurant to have a longer period between inspections (11-13 months) than would be possible even if they receive an A through reinspection or OATH hearing. (5-7 or 3-5 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every food service establishment receives an unannounced, onsite inspection at least once a year. The inspector may visit anytime the restaurant is receiving or preparing food or drink, or is open to the public. The inspector records observed violations in a handheld computer during the inspection. Each violation is associated with a range of points depending on the type and extent of the violation, and the risk it poses to the public. At the end of the inspection, the points are added together for an inspection score. Lower inspection scores indicate better compliance with the Health Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Code violations are classified as 'Critical' or 'General'. Critical violations are more likely to to contribute to foodborne illnesses and are a substantial risk to public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "A score of 13 points or less results in an A rating. Receiving Critical violations will not immediately put a restaurant over the 13 points necessary to receive an A grade and likewise it is still possible (but very rare) to recieve more than 13 points on general violations alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of all Critical and General Violations can be found here: [The Blue Book](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/blue-book.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "The New York City Open Data Project records of every violation citation up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for all active restaurants within the city\n",
    "source : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j\n",
    "https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/About_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection_Data_on_NYC_OpenData_092418.docx\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for this project was pulled on the 17th of August 2019 and is up to that date. \n",
    "\n",
    "Github Notebook: https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Inspection%20Dataframe%20construction.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset records indivdiual violation citations for all Dept of Health inspections including those that are not related to food safety and are not graded/scored. Each violation is a row within the dataset recording the identifying the violation code and description  and features for the restaurant (CAMIS:unique identifier, name, location, cuisine type) and the inspection (type of inspection, date, total inspection score). \n",
    "To perform Exploratory Data Analysis the data was cleaned in the following steps:\n",
    "- The dataset was reconfigured in Pandas to group violations into inspection events based on CAMIS identifier and date.  \n",
    "- \"Initial Inspections\" were extracted. These are the regular Dept of Health food safety inspections\n",
    "- The inspection Score was determined from the violations\n",
    "- Violations were encoded categorically \n",
    "- Grade was missing in many cases (for various reasons) and was determined from inspection Score:\n",
    "    - A <=13\n",
    "    - B 14 to 28\n",
    "    - C > 28\n",
    "- Critical flags are summed for the inspection based on the violations recorded and encoded in a feature\n",
    "- Inspections from prior to mid 2016 were dropped as these represent a very sparse set of inspections compared to the main set\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/ins_fulltime.png' height = 400 width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspections from after to the 20th of July 2019 were also dropped as these have not yet been finalised by OATH hearing leading to a significantly higher average\n",
    "<img src='images/ins_croptime.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some cyclical effects on inspection average were observed but the time scale is very short to extract annual cyclical effects and this was not further explored in this project but is included in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "All further analysis was performed based on this initial inspection data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Inspection Analysis\n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Initial%20inspections%20analysis.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/init_ins_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Approxiamtely 60% of all inital inspections result in an A rating.The distribution of intital inspections scores is left skewed with a long tail. The median score is 12 which is an A rating however the long tail drags up the mean to 15.7 which is a B rating. The distribution peaks sharply just before the A cutoff, inspections are at least partially subjective and inspectors have leeway when awarding points and violations. Inspectors appear to be more inclined to give a restaurant a \"just made it\" A over a \"just missed it\" B \n",
    "\n",
    "Scarily, the highest Score recorded in an inspection is 166 and the establishment was shut down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Violation Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/vio_corr_heat.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall heatmap is very hard to read and the overwhelming majority of violations correlate only weakly with score. A tighter focus is taken on only the features that have a correlation factor with Score of over 0.3\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/vio_most_corr.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "No individual violation correlated very strongly with score which indicates that violations are spread and restaurants are not all constantly tripping up over the same violation. Critical flags are the most serious types of violations, the sum of critical flags for an inspection correlates strongly with Score as these are dependant measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical Flag violations present a more serious risk to public health and safety and are scored higher than general violations. For example, storing cold food items above 41 deg F allows harmful bacteria to grow and is a critical violation, not posting a \"wash hands\" sign in the restroom is a general violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src ='images/crit_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of critical flags is left skewed with most establishments manage to receive just 1 or 2 critical flag violation on their inspection (median = 1 and mean= 1.7) however the distribution for critical flag violations has a long tail with the highest number of critical violations received during an inspection being 13 (the establishment was shut down)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/crit_boxplots.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is no easy feat, not receiving any critical flag violations virtually garuntees an A. 99.97% of all inspections that do not result in a critical flag violation are awarded an A grade. Those restaurants that do receive critical flag violations on their inspections are still very capable of receiveing an A grade and the median score for is 13 which is a passing A grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/crit_score_plot.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although critical flag violations are considered a serious risk to public health a single critical violation is also very likely (95% chance) to result in an A grade. Once a restaurant passes this threshold however their chances of an A drop off significantly and just 41% of restaurants that receive 2 critical flags are awarded an A grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vermin\n",
    "\n",
    "5 vermin related violations were identified:\n",
    "- evidence or presence of \n",
    "    - rats (04K)\n",
    "    - mice (04L)\n",
    "    - cockroaches (04M)\n",
    "    - flies (04N)\n",
    "- lack of \"vermin proofing\" (08A)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/vermin_heat.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each violation correlated  weakly with other vermin types which indicates it is rare for restaurants to have multiple vermin infestations but rather vermin related violations tend to be isolated events. Violations for lack of vermin-proofing are non-critical and are the most common. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/vermin_bar.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rat related violations are the least common and mice are the most common. Is New York's famous rat problem really a mouse problem? Or are inspectors unable to distinguish between evidence of the presence of mice and rates (bitten bags, droppings, etc) and are more likely to attribute such violations to the less serious (or at least less serious sounding) mice violation?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Categories Breakdown \n",
    "\n",
    "The features of restaurants related to the health inspection score are grouped into three categories: \n",
    "- Location - Where the restaurant is in New York \n",
    "- Type - The distinguishing features of the Restaurant itself\n",
    "- History - How the restaurant has performed on it's past inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "After reconstructing the inspection data around CAMIS and Date tp grup by inspections rather than individual violations, the restaurant data was also isolated by CAMIS and this was merged with the inspection data \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City can be divided up in a variety of ways for this project I have used Community Boards to break up the city and draw location based trends. There 69 Community Boards including Joint Interst Areas such as Central Park in Manhattan\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_boards_of_New_York_City\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Community Board\n",
    "Github Notebooks: \n",
    "https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Restaurant%20Data%20Isolation.ipynb\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='images/rest_density_edit.PNG'> \n",
    "<center><b>Restaurant Density Map</b></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurants are spread throughout New York but are at their most concentrated in Midtown and Lower Manhattan\n",
    "\n",
    "The different preferences and ethnic make-up of Community Boards can also be visualised by their most popular restaurant type\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/rest_pop_edit.PNG'>\n",
    "<center><b> Most Popular Cuisine Style by Community Board </b></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also visualise the average inspection score for each Community Board\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='images/cb_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of average scores across community boards is normally distributed about a mean of 15 with a few outliers with low scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/cb_logcount_avescore.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Scatter plot there is a visible cluster of points with high restaurant counts and high average scores, this is the standard most community boards are achieving.\n",
    "Unfortuantely it doesn't appear that the best food safety practices are in the most restaurant heavy neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Restaurant Type\n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Restaurant%20Type.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cuisine Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 84 different cuisine descriptions attached to the restaurants inspected by taking the average score for inspections for cuisine styles we can view a distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/cuis_score_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest scoring cuisine styles are mostly simple things like hotdogs and nuts/confectionary where the smaller scope of cooking/preparation most likely makes it significantly easier to adhere to the city food safety standards\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/cuis_5pop_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cuisine styles that were most popular in Communuity Boards are given a distribution above. Interstingly all appear to bimodal with a peak just before the A grade cutoff and another in the higher teens. The tendency for inspectors to ggive restauarnts that 'just made it' A instead of a 'just missed it' B creates a \"Valley of Leniency\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaruants with more than one location operating under the same business name are classed as a chain for the purposes of this project. Popular chains have many locations across the city and have set practices and training programs that govern their food safety across all their outlets. This can lead to better food safety outcomes and lower inspection scores\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/chain_score_boxplots.PNG'>\n",
    "<img src='images/chain_distplot.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify this statistically I have used a 2 sided Welch's T-test with unequal variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "h0: null hypothesis: the two populations have equal means\n",
    "h1: alternate hypothesis: the two populations have unequal means\n",
    "\n",
    "Let our p-value threshold to reject the null hypothesis be 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Our calculated p-value is 1.3e-184 - much lower than our threshold so we reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### History\n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Twice.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Previous Inspection Score \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset covers approximately 3 years and each restaurant is inspected on a minimum of yearly basis so we expect there to be multiple inspections available for all restaurants excepting those that have been open for less time than their reinspection cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/ins_count_dist.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The small subsection of restaurants that have only been inspected once are excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining inspections the inspection score and number of critical flags from the same restaurant and latest prior date was added as a feature of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score and previous score correlated more weakly than expected at just 0.23. This would indicate that restaurants are not necessarily 'stuck in a rut'. Improvement and disimprovement occur at an equal rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/score_prev_scat.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/improvement.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common scenario is for an A rated restaurant to maintain its A, however, more than a third of all inspections result in a change of grade in either direction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Previous Inspection Critical Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of critical flags received on a ninspection likewise correlated weakly across subsequent inspections at just 0.27. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/crit_prev_boxplots.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor inspection performance and fines do not necessarily teach an establishment their lesson. It may be necessary to improve or re-think the penalty system for health code violations to ensure that process improvemnts are made and kept in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning was used to create an A grade predictor. A matrix was created using the features explored above for Type, Location and History. The problem was approached in 3 different fashions outlined below. All are binary Classifier models for an A grade\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Matrix\n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Sparse%20matrix%20classifier%203%20-prev_score.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "The features for Cuisine Description and Community Board are one-hot encoded from the categorical features to create a sparse binary matrix. Existing binary feature is_chain is also added and the features for previous inspection score and previous inspection which are continuously numerical.\n",
    "\n",
    "An baseline is created using an ADABoost Classifier  that achieves an accuracy of 64%. Improvements on the model are made by resampling the data using SMOTE techniques to remove weight bias from the target sample weights andusing a grid-search with 3 fold cross validation and XGBoost Classifier as the estimator to give a best estimator with an accuracy and score of 68%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Statistics \n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Summary%20Stats%20Classifier%20Model%202%20-prev_score.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a different approach from the above model, categorical features from the Cuisine Description and Community board are substituted for the summary statistics for each categorical entry. The Cuisine Description and Community Board mean standard deviation and overall count for each entry are used. The numerical features for previous score and previous critical violations are also used as well as the is_chain binary feature. This creates a significantly smaller matrix than the one used above reducing the number of features from 156 to 9. \n",
    "\n",
    "A baseline accuracy is established using a simple Logistic Regressor giving an accuracy of 63%. The model is improved by resampling using SMOTE techniques to remove bias due to target sample weight and applying a standard scaler to all features to prevent artifical weighting of features. The Classifier is also optimised using grid-search with 3 fold cross validation and XGBoost Classifier is used and accuracy is improved to 67% with a score of 68%\n",
    "\n",
    "An equal level of accuracy was achieved using summary statistics as one-hot encoded categorical features with a big improvement in training time. The training time for the one-hot encoded sparse matrix for the best XGBoost estimator is 16 seconds whereas the training time for the summary statistics matrix best XGBoost estimator is just 1.5 seconds, one tenth of the time. This reduction in training time with no loss in accuracy makes the Summary Statistics learning model much more agile for a deployed algorithm that will need to be retrained regularly as need data become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manhattan Only Statistics\n",
    "Github Notebook https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide/blob/master/Manhattan%20model%20Classifier%202%20prev_score.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary statistics method above was also used on smaller subsection of the restaurant inspection data representing only Manhattan. The same level of accuracy was possible again using a resampled and scaled feature matrix and a grid-search with 3 fold cross validation to optimise an XGBoost Classifier. This again achieved notable improvements in training time but the Manhattan trained model performed very poorly when classifying the full dataset with other boroughs included. The use of Manhattan as a representative sample appears to be a flawed premise and I would caution against extrapolating any model trained only on Manhattan data to a broader geographical area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep learning neural network was built using Keras to further improve up accuracy of the machine learning models. Accuracy on par with the XGBoost Classifiers was not achieved and overfitting occurred quickly. Further development in this area is considered in Future Work\n",
