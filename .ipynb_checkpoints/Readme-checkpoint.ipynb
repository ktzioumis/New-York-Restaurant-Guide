    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygene inspects all food service establishments to make sure they meet Health Code requirements. Adherence to Health Code food safey requirements is necessary to prevent foodborne illness after it's introduction in 2011 instances of salmonella in New York City fell by 14% in the first year (source: https://ny.eater.com/2019/6/28/18761345/department-of-health-letter-grades-nyc-restaurant-rules) but it has also generates millions of dollars in fines to restaurants. Annual totals for restaurant fines from Dept. of Health Inspections top \\\\$30 million annually and reached \\\\$54 million in 2012 (source: https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/new-york-city-fine-revenues-update/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Penalties for Health Code Violations are effectively twofold. Where violations are found a Notice of Violation is issued and a hearing Date is set for the Health Hearing Division of the Office of Trials and Hearings (OATH), violations can be contested and fines are determined at the OATH hearing. Fines can range from \\\\$200 to \\\\$2,000 and higher for repeat offences. The second form of penalty can occur if a restaurant fails to achieve an A grade. According to a 2012 survey conducted by Baruch College at the City University of New York, 88% of New Yorkers  used the letter grades in making their dining decisions, and 76% felt more confident eating in an “A” grade restaurant(source: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/pr031-17.page). Failing to achieve or maintain an A grade can result in damage to a restaurant's reputation, negative press coverage (Upscale restaurant Per Se's 2014 poor inspection result was reported on by Business Insider - https://www.businessinsider.com/per-se-grade-pending-2014-3) and a loss of customer confidence that leads to a drop in foot traffic, sales and profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of an A grade has restaurants bending over backwards to beat the inspectors (source: https://ny.eater.com/2019/6/28/18761345/department-of-health-letter-grades-nyc-restaurant-rules) and has led to a booming industry of restaurant consultants, performing mock inspections and legal service that will assist in challenging violations at the OATH Hearing. The ability to predict, prior to inspection, whether a restaurant is likely to receive the highly coveted A is an invaluable tool in preparing for the inspection event. \n",

    "## Inspection Process\n",
    "<img src='inspection_process.PNG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "source: [Inspection Cycle Overview](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/inspection-cycle-overview.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Inspections that do not result in an immediate A are subject to re-inspection and/or OATH hearings and may still be able to obtain an A rating but the stigma assosciated with displaying a \"Grade Pending\" Sign and the costs assosciated with tribunal hearings and process adaptations in preparation for reinspection are costly. The ideal outcome is to receive 13 points or fewer during the inspection and immediately be able to display an A rating. Additionally, receiving an A rating allows the restaurant to have a longer period between inspections (11-13 months) than would be possible even if they receive an A through reinspection or OATH hearing. (5-7 or 3-5 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every food service establishment receives an unannounced, onsite inspection at least once a year. The inspector may visit anytime the restaurant is receiving or preparing food or drink, or is open to the public. The inspector records observed violations in a handheld computer during the inspection. Each violation is associated with a range of points depending on the type and extent of the violation, and the risk it poses to the public. At the end of the inspection, the points are added together for an inspection score. Lower inspection scores indicate better compliance with the Health Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Code violations are classified as 'Critical' or 'General'. Critical violations are more likely to to contribute to foodborne illnesses and are a substantial risk to public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "A score of 13 points or less results in an A rating. Receiving Critical violations will not immediately put a restaurant over the 13 points necessary to receive an A grade and likewise it is still possible to recieve more than 13 points on general violations alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of all Critical and General Violations can be found here: [The Blue Book](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/blue-book.pdf)\n",

    "## The Data\n",
    "The New York City Open Data Project records of every violation citation up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for all active restaurants within the city\n",
    "source : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for this project was pulled on the 17th of August 2019 and is up to that date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset records indivdiual violation citations for all Dept of Health inspections including those that are not related to food safety and are not graded/scored. Each violation is a row within the dataset recording the identifying the violation code and description  and features for the restaurant (CAMIS:unique identifier, name, location, cuisine type) and the inspection (type of inspection, date, total inspection score). \n",
    "To perform Exploratory Data Analysis the data was cleaned in the following steps:\n",
    "- The dataset was reconfigured in Pandas to group violations into inspection events based on CAMIS identifier and date.  \n",
    "- \"Initial Inspections\" were extracted. These are the regular Dept of Health food safety inspections\n",
    "- Inspections from prior to mid 2016 were dropped as these represent a very sparse set of inspections compared to the main set\n",
    "- Inspections from after to the 20th of July 2019 were also dropped as these have not yet been finalised by OATH hearing leading to a significantly higher average\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src='ins_croptime.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some cyclical effects on inspection average were observed but the time scale is very short to extract annual cyclical effects and this was not further explored in this project but is included in future work.\n",
